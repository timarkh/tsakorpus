# There will be a 'para_alignments' collection that will contain alignments between sentences in a parallel corpus (or in a monolingual corpus where sentences have translations into a metalanguage).
# An aligned segment contains several tiers. Each tier corresponds to one language (or variant of the text). Each tier contains links to the sentences it includes.
# The elements of the collection would look like this:

{
  "_id": ...,
  "prev_id": ...,        # ID of the previous aligned segment
  "next_id": ...,        # ID of the next aligned segment
  "tiers": [
    {
      "name": "...",     # name of the tier (e. g. name of the language)
      "sent_ids": [...], # IDs of the sentences included in this tier
      "data": {...}      # any additional information about the segment as key-value pairs
    },
    ...
  ]
}
